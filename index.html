    <h2>Hello! My name is Joshua Hale. I'm currently looking for a junior role as a software engineer.</h2>
    <p>I have been coding for a couple months now and have come a long way. I am comfortable with HTML, CSS, Git &
        GitHub, and have a basic understanding of JavaScript (using functions, if...else statements, for loops, etc...).
        I don't have a bunch of impressive projects to showcase yet, but I am enjoying coding more and more every 
        day and I do my best to learn something new every day. In my free time I enjoy things like trail running, rock climbing, and 
        reading.
    </p>
